<h3>CHRIS/Proba Geometric Correction</h3>

<h5>Introduction</h5>

<p>
    CHRIS/Proba is a system designed for multi-angular image acquisition of a given target, with the capability
    along-track and across-track pointing increasing its overpass frequency. In order to in-crease the radiometric
    signal the platform performs a slow-down manoeuvre consisting in rotating while scanning to keep the target
    for a longer time under the sensor. Besides, the scan direction is reversed during the acquisition of the
    second and fourth images to reduce the acceleration needed for the operation. These characteristics introduce
    strong perspective distortions, especially for the first and last images with larger observation zenith angles.
</p>

<p>
    Many applications require the images to be geometrically referenced and/or rectified. In particular for those that
    make use of multi-angular information the geometric processing must be very accurate.

<h3>User Interface</h3>

<p>
    The geometric correction tool can be invoked from VISAT tool menu by selecting
    the <b>Geomatric Correction...</b> command in the <b>CHRIS-Box</b> submenu. In the command line it is
    available by means of the Graph Processing Tool <code>gpt</code> which is located in the BEAM <code>bin</code>
    directory. For further information type <code>gpt chris.PerformGeometricCorrection -h</code> at the command prompt.
</p>

<p>
    The geometric correction adds tie point grids for latitude, longitude, as well as view azimuth and zenith angles
    to a CHRIS/Proba product.
</p>

<p>
    Selecting the <b>Geometric Correction...</b> command from the VISAT tool menu pops up the
    following dialog:

</p>

<p>
    You may be asked to update the auxiiary time tables, which are included in the module. Time tables
    are updated at <a href="ftp://maia.usno.navy.mil/ser7/">ftp://maia.usno.navy.mil/ser7/</a> every
    week. If you work with recent CHRIS/Proba products, you will need to update the time tables regularly.

<h5>Source Product Group</h5>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Name:</b>
    Here the user specifies the name of the source product. The combo box presents
    a list of all products open in VISAT. The user may select one of these
    or, by clicking on the button next to the combo box, choose a product
    from the file system.
</p>

<h5>Target Product Group</h5>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Name:</b>
    Used to specify the name of the target product.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Save as:</b>
    Used to specify whether the target product should be saved to the file system. The
    combo box presents a list of file formats, currently BEAM-DIMAP, GeoTIFF, and HDF5.
    The text field allows to specify a target directory.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Open in VISAT:</b>
    Used to specify whether the target product should be opened in VISAT. When the
    the target product is not saved, it is opened in VISAT automatically.
</p>

<h5>Processing Parameters Panel</h5>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Telemetry repository:</b>
    Use this field to specify the directory containing the CHRIS telemetry data. Note that
    the parent directory of the source product is searched for CHRIS telemetry data <em>before</em>
    the local repository is.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Use target altitude:</b>
    Use this field to specify that the nominal target altitude shall be taken into account when
    calculating the longitude and latitude coordinates. <em>Note that the resulting geo-coding
    is more accurate, but not suitable for ortho-rectification.</em>.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Include pitch and roll angles:</b>
    Use this field to specify that the instrument pitch and roll angles, which are calculated anyway, shall
    included in the product. This option is for diagnostics only.
</p>

<h5>Button Group</h5>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Run</b>
    Creates the target product. The geometric correction is actually deferred until the target band data are accessed,
    either by writing the product to the file system or by viewing the band data. When the <b>Save as</b> option is
    checked, the atmospheric correction is triggered automatically.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Close</b>
    Closes the dialog.

<p class="i1">
    <b>Help</b>
