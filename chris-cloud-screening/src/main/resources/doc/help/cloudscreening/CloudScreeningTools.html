<h3>CHRIS/PROBA Cloud Screening</h3>

<p>
    The Cloud Screening Tools is used to mask cloud and cloudy pixels in CHRIS images.
    The cloud masking algorithm described below provides cloud probability and abundances for
    each pixel instead of a single flag.
</p>

<h4>Cloud Screening Algorithm</h4>

<p>
    <b>The cloud screening algorithm consists of the following steps:</b>
</p>
<ol>
    <li><b>Image Pre-Processing:</b> TOA reflectance is estimated from the CHRIS products to remove in practice the
        dependence on particular illumination conditions (day of the year and angular configuration).
    </li>
    <li><b>Feature extraction:</b> physically-inspired features are extracted to increase separability of clouds and
        surface taking into account that the measured spectral signature depends on the illumination (solar and
        observation conditions: TOA reflectance is already estimated), the atmosphere (cloud height: oxygen and water
        vapour atmospheric absorptions are used to estimate the optical path), and the surface (cloud reflectance: its
        spectral signature is white and bright).
    </li>
    <li><b>Image clustering:</b> an unsupervised Expectation-Maximization (EM) clustering algorithm is performed on the
        extracted features in order to separate clouds from the ground-cover while obtaining posterior probabilities of
        each pixel to each cluster.
    </li>
    <li><b>Cluster labeling:</b> resulting clusters are subsequently labeled into geo-physical classes according to
        their spectral signatures. Once all clusters corresponding to clouds have been identified, it is straightforward
        to merge all the clusters belonging to a cloud type (cloud-clusters). In the clustering of the extracted
        features, the EM algorithm provides a probabilistic membership for each cluster, thus the probability of being
        cloud is computed as the sum of the posteriors of the cloud-clusters.
    </li>
    <li><b>Spectral unmixing:</b> a Fully Constrained Linear Spectral Unmixing (FCLSU) is applied to the image in order
        to obtain the fraction of cloud content for each pixel (rather than flags or a binary classification).
    </li>
</ol>
<p>The final cloud product is obtained combining the cloud probability and the cloud fraction by means of a
    pixel-by-pixel multiplication. That is, combining two complementary sources of information processed by independent
    methods: the cloud probability (obtained from the extracted features), which is close to one in cloud-like pixels
    and close to zero in remaining areas; and the cloud abundance or mixing (obtained from the spectra).</p>


<h4>User Interface</h4>


<p>
    The Cloud Screening tool can be invoked from VISAT <b>Tools</b> menu by selecting
    the <b>Compute Cloud Mask</b> command in the <b>CHRIS/PROBA Tools</b> submenu. It performs the cloud screening on
    the currently selected product, if applicable.
</p>

<p>
    Selecting the <b>Compute Cloud Mask</b> command brings up a progress dialog :
</p>

<p align="center">
    <img src="images/ClusterAnalysisProgress.jpg" alt="Cluster Analysis Progress Dialog"/>
</p>

<p>
    While the progress dialog is shown the first three steps (Image Pre-Processing, Feature extraction, Image
    clustering) of the algorithm are performed. This might take some time. Depending on the size of the scene and on
    the performance of your system.
</p>

<p>
    After the cluster analysis has been performed two scene images are opened. One is an RGB image of the scene the
    other is the resulting image of the clustering. Additionally a window is opened showing a table with an entry for
    each class.
</p>

<p class="inote"><b>Hint:</b><br/>
    Use the <b>Tile Evenly</b> command in the <b>Window</b> menu to display both scenes side by side. <br/>
    It's also useful to synchronize both views. Use the chain symbol in the
    <a href="visat/NavigationWindow.html#synchronise">Navigation Window</a> for that purpose.

<p align="center">
    <img src="images/CloudLabelingWindows.jpg" alt="Manual Cloud Labeling"/>
</p>

<p>
    <b>Manual Cloud Labeling</b><br/>
    Mark the classes as cloud which you can identify to be a cloud class.<br/>
    If one class contains cloud and surface samples you can reject them. Thereby the concerned samples will be
    re-distributed to the classes with the second highest probability.<br/>
    You can also enable a spectral unmixing on the cloud pixel spectra. This will give a better separation between
    real cloud pixels and those which were wrongly classified as cloud by the clustering.<br/>
    After you're satisfied with your labeling settings you can click on the <b>Create Cloud Mask</b> button.
    The resulting mask is added to the source product as band named <b>cloud_product</b>.
</p>

<p class="inote"><b class="note">Note:</b> The spectral unmixing gives you better results in uncertain cases, but note
    that it is very time consuming.
</p>

<h4>The Cloud Mask Result</h4>
<ul>
    <li><b>without spectral unmixing</b> results in a binary mask, only distinguishing between one and zero.
        Where one means cloud and zero means cloud free.<br/>
    </li>
    <li><b>with spectral unmixing</b> results in a gradient mask, whose values vary from zero and one. The higher the
        value the higher is the probability that the sample is a cloud.<br/>
    </li>
</ul>
